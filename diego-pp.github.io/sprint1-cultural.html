    <h5 class="learnplantitle"><b>.Strengths.</h5></b>
    <p class="intro2">I’m an action person, straight forward. I like to follow what I think, and do what I dream to do. I like challenges and
    taking away stuff from my bucket list. Love, friendship, family, sharing, and saying sorry when it is needed. Ask when
    you need help. Help when someone asks you. Social personality. Fast learner, depending on the field. Dedicated.
    </p>
    <br>
<h5 class="learnplantitle"><b>.Weaknesses.</h5></b>
<p class="intro2">Cause I like to learn deep and well, many times I fall in rabbit holes, (wasting time?).
Sometimes I need to manage my focus properly, avoiding distractions, most of the time social. My English writing skills
are not the best! Some times I overthink.


</p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in
that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h5>
<p class="intro2">When I was 16 years old, I was with my mother, at her friends place. This apartment was on level 14. A big fire started,
burning one of the apartments of level 11. All the people between the level 11 and 14 had been desperately running up
the stairs, to our apartment, trying to escape from the black and toxic smoke. It was impossible to survive breathing
this. After 20 minutes, there were already about 20 people in our level 14 apartment. The last person to come was an old
man, upset, saying that his wife was in the middle of the stairs. I was the only young and strong person there. In that
situation, I needed to act and think fast, so I put a wet towel on my face, and I found her 2 floors down, on the
ground. I carried her on my back, 2 levels up, through the dark smoke (intense, walking blind). I saved her life. She
make me a massive cake to say thank you.
I think that going through a big fire to save a life, putting myself at risk, was an ethical decision, and our values
are truly exposed in a life or death situation, even more if my mom is there, one of the main people of influence in my
early days.


</p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h5>
<p class="intro2">Argentina is a multicultural country, and my city, Buenos Aires, is very cosmopolitan, with a huge cultural blend. I
have roots from Italy, Spain and Portugal. I think that the large amount of immigration in my country was a big
influence for the whole culture, values and collective identity. We normally are very passional and straight forward,
with a culture of hard work. I love NZ, I have been living here for 6 years, but I belong to Argentina. I say that nz is
home away from home
</p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning
obstacles.</h5>
<p class="intro2">Architecture is a practical profession, what you design is material, people can see it on the screen, in a model, on
paper - they can touch it. Design disciples expose ourselves to others critical opinion. This can be great or not to
deal with. Sometimes we can create a beautiful project or things that are not that nice, and constantly need to be
modified and improved. This is the design process. I’m beginner 100%, but I’m sure that is the same in web development.
I have been through that experience and this can be a little help for me.
At the same time this can be a big weakness. Particularly to compare the result of my current web developer tools and
status. The functional or aesthetic product that I can do today in this new field is a very low level, and this can be
frustrating.

</p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was
resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
what other strategies you would try now, and why..</h5>
<p class="intro2">I have been working for 3 years in an architecture office in Argentina. One of my teachers from uni offered me that job.
At that stage I was in the 4th year, one away from graduation. One of our workmates was an older woman, with a lot of
professional experience and technical knowledge, but a horrendous, selfish human being. She never finished the degree,
she owed a couple of final assessments. I think that she wasn’t feeling confident to go, because of her age. That
insecurity was always present with her, but transformed in passive aggression to the other people from the office,
hiding information or been nasty in many different ways. Unfortunately we had been dealing with her presence during
those years. I feel a bit bad talking about this, because she passed away. Mainly the problem was the main boss, but she
was productive in different aspects, and to fire her would cost a lot of money. The strategies for this case was a lot
of social interaction, we tried to include her. I also shared my knowledge with her (I was working in 3d software and
she 2d). Unfortunately though, everything was a short term solution.
