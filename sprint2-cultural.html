<h3 class="learnplantitle">.Learning Plan 1.</h5>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.What is your long term goal and or career pathway?.</h5>
  <p class="intro2">First, I would like to have a deep and solid understanding of all the main concepts. I Would like to manage the coding,
                   good enough for work with freedom, developing the ability to leave obstacles behind, and improve technical communication
                   skills. I love design, and I would like to be fluent with coding, for create with freedom, and in some point, I'm aiming
                   to blend this with architectural design.
  </p>
<br>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.A description of your own strengths and limitations.</h5>
  <p class="intro2">Strengths? I can say that I like learning challenges. After studying architecture for many years, with hard and
                  professional dedication, I feel confident and excited facing new learning paths. Also, I feel good with my social
                  skills, I like to work with people.
                  Limitations? I shouldn't compare my architectural design skills with my beginner coding ones, a cause can be very
                  frustrating. I also need to improve a lot of my English writing skills (Thats not DEV curriculum lol)..
  </p>
    <br>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.Managing workload programme.</h5>
  <p class="intro2">I’m still learning day by day how to manage the workload, as is all new knowledge, I wanna go deep, and sometimes I fall
                   in the rabbit holes. I don’t like the feeling that I’m not learning deep and strict, and I understand the reality that
                   Google is the new god. i wonder if this would lead us to bad professional practices?. I normally use 9 hours per day. If
                   I’m enjoying and focusing, times go fast. I have been working long hours with computers, drawing with architectural
                   software.
                   We All have a personal life, and people to take care. Can be selfish with the others stick ourselves in the computer
                   24/7. Good balance with breaks and distraction, and understand that deadlines are not the end of the world.
  </p>
    <br>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h5>
  <p class="intro2">I expect to have support from DEV team, committed as we are with the sprints. Particulary with some technical support,
                    as I say before, sometimes I feel like google can be dangerous, guiding to bad practice or weak foundational knowledge.
  </p>
    <br>
    <br>
<h3 class="learnplantitle">.Learning Plan 2 (S5 addition).</h5>
    <h5 class="learnplantitle">.What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?.</h5>
      <p class="intro2">At the moment I’m not that focused in the outcomes in term of career paths. My main goal is to
                   learn properly or as best
                   as I can and have a good solid base, after this, ill find out the next move, following my new knowledge.
                   Definitely I
                   would like to have a clear idea and a good understanding about coding, in order to have freedom to design.
                   Design is my
                   main goal, and eventually maybe find out a connection between coding and different fields of projects and design
                   disciplines
    </p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">this answer will be similar to the sprint 2 one, adding that, after the tech challenges of foundations, I still think
                      and feel that a solid technic base requires a lot of effort, practice and hard work, in order to succeed. This just is
                      the beginning.
    </p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">
                   I am naturally open about all the non tech stuff, that is about to come. I'm Looking forward to learn, how to work and
                   communicate in team in this new field
    </p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself
        while at EDA?.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">
                    Learn how to working in groups, improve communication skills and feedbacks are definitely on the list. All and
                    everything which is related to constructive communication
    </p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">
                    My expectations are to keep going deeper and make a solid beginner knowledge. through work and communicate with people
                    around, rather than the isolated learning style (I’m no saying that is bad) of foundations. I expect from bootcamp team
                    to lead us as support us through the process, that is the main reason for all of us to be here.
    </p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">
                   This answer is connected to the last one. I finded through Foundations that the course is 85% JS directed. I feel that I
                   will need to invest a nice amount of time outside, or after bootcamp to incorporate and manage properly HTML , CSS and
                   frameworks. I just expect to leave DEV with a good base, that can help me to go properly and self-directed in my next
                   solo learning journeys.
