<h5 class="learnplantitle"><h5 class="learnplantitle">.What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?.</h5>
      <p class="intro2">I founded very interesting all the learning related to neuroplasticity and growth mindset. Emotional intelligence as
       well, those 3 topics planted a seed in my self. I also expended time reading about all this in my free time, out of DEV
       duties.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="intro2">Also, I think that writhe about ours strengths and weakness, give us the chance to explore and open ourselves, showing a
       possible path for improve and modify things.</p>
       <br>
       <p class="intro2">In mi case, that im Spanish speaker, I been really enjoying go through all this deep dive content in English language. I
       think that is a nice add, that warms up the course content.</p>
       <br>

       </p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">.What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?.</h5>
        <p class="intro2">
        Empathy and self-awareness could be determinant, as is important in groups. Behaviour , attitude and self-control could
        play a key position, not only in team works, also in individuals compromise and solo challenges.
       </p>

<h5 class="learnplantitle">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>
        <p class="intro2">
            Some of the content is extremely attractive, and of course, important to add. Extra knowledge is always good. Sometimes
            I was just wondering if is scientifically approved or if they are still theories, this can make a big difference.
        </p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning</h5>
        <p class="intro2">
         The core learning part of foundations, for me was feeling more like a break or a calm part, as I finded more challenging
         tech. I normally enjoy reading, so I didn’t find it like a challenge compared with the coding content. Definetly the
         most challenging part was dealing with deep dive material in English instead Spanish..
        </p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
        bootcamp course</h5>
        <p class="intro2">
            As u guys explained, u want to give us some human-social skills, in order the satisfy what tech industry needs today.
            Not sure if we will cover this with our core reflections to be honest, but could be a start point I guess. I think that
            we understand this point.
        </p>
<h5 class="learnplantitle">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to
        practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h5>
        <p class="intro2">
            Knowledge never is a waste of time, but I already express in my reflection’s files, that I think and feel that the tech
            and coding learning need a little review or a better in balance, in order to give us the chance to practice and soak a
            bit more the tech content. In my opinion this amount of knowledge, for make it part of us better, need between 8 and 10
            weeks minimum .
