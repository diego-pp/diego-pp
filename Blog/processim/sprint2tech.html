<p class="text1pad">Marging, border and padding are referring to space between elements. both have to do with white space 
    around an element.
      Once we understand the difference between margin and padding we'll be able to make better design decisions. Padding is
    the space thatâ€™s inside the element between the element and the border. Padding goes around all four sides of the
    content and you can target and change the padding for each side with CSS. Margin is the space between the border and
    next element.
    The space outside the border between it and the other elements is the margin. like padding, it's possible to target
    all four sides of an element to change it's margin. The easiest way to understand the difference between margin and
    padding is through an image. The image below shows what each part of something like a paragraph element looks
     like.

    above is also referred to as the box model. The box model is used when working with CSS. It's important to
    understand how the box model works so you can understand how width and height of your elements work. When you set the
    width and height of an element, it's just for the content area. You'll probably have to do some math to make sure your
    elements are lining up correctly because of the margin and padding. Something important to note that can get confusing
    is that the padding and margin will still be a part of your element even if you don't include a border. In
    the image below there is to blocks of content with no added border. You can see how the margin and padding are still
    valid.</p><img class="paddingpic" src="23.jpg" width="500" height="100" <!-- this is a comment. -->
