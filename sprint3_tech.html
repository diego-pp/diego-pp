    <h5 class="learnplantitle">.An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">As a simple analogy, I think that an architectural and urban example can work well. The HTML can be define as the
    structure and foundation of the building, that holds the whole project. CSS is in charge of the texture and the
    esthetical aspects, but this can be structural as well (position of the elements, margin, padding), in not only look and
    fashion. But related to a building can de compared with the detailed, and esthetical decision, like colour, textures,
    material, opacity, etc. And if we zoom out in the urban scale , like in google maps, que can see how the whole web is
    build up (?)
        
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5 class="learnplantitle">.Control flow and loops.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">The loop can be explained as a every day situation. Particularly comes to my mind the week of sprint 3, my self
    going to kitchen from my chair over and over again to fill up my coffee cup, till my brain say “Diego, enough caffeine”
    (condition). The loops runs over and over till a condition is met.
    I moved house last week at the same time during the sprint 3 week (intense). My new place has a mezzanine, where is the
    bedroom, facing the living room and the balcony. I started cleaning at the top, in order to avoid dust on the first
    level. This could explain a bit how control flows work, from top to bottom, following a tree logical system.

    </p>
    <br><h5 class="learnplantitle">.Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">The DOM can be described as an interface for HTML files which represents the complex document structure, style, content,
    and much more information. The DOM works and represents the files and documents as elements or nodes, and because of
    this, we can connect to the page through programming languages. The DOM can be manipulated through Javascript.
    </p>
    <br><h5 class="learnplantitle">.Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">In JavaScript, everything is an object. Objects are defined by their properties (data) and types. Those properties will
    define the object characteristics. We know that variables are like containers for data values. Arrays allows us to
    access to our values in an specific order, and also can store different or multiple values in just a single variable.
    
    </p>
    <br><h5 class="learnplantitle">.Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h5>
    <p class="intro2">Functions re one of the fundamental and main characteristics of JS. When we set up a function, we need to define s set
    of statements, that will perform our task. Functions are execute when they are called in. their logical dynamic allow us
    to change the argument using the same code, and this will produce different product, what makes them versatile.
